# 📝 Mission: Petition

A simple project designed to make racial injustice petition signing as easy and accessible as possible.

[![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-v1.4%20adopted-ff69b4.svg)](code-of-conduct.md)

This is a basic Vue.js app that stores [a list](https://github.com/xdesro/petition-tracker/blob/master/petitions.json) of signable petitions to LocalStorage and keeps track of which the user has signed.

## 🎉 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

It's dangerous to go alone! You'll need these:

- Node.js
- NPM

### Local Development

Follow these steps to get started developing this project.

1. 👯‍♂️ Clone the respository locally and `cd` into the directory.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:xdesro/petition-tracker.git

cd petition-tracker
```

2. 📦 Install dependencies.

```sh
npm install
```

3. 🏗 Run the project for local development. This will start a hot-reloading server at `localhost:8080` (or similar, if :8080 is taken).

```sh
npm run serve
```

4. 🌌 Build the app for production deployment! (Netlify will do this when changes are merged to master, you probably don't need to do this.)

```sh
npm run build
```

This project was bootstrapped with Vue CLI. There are more detailed explanations of how everything works in the [Vue CLI docs](https://cli.vuejs.org/).
